# GitHub Actions Release Fix Summary

## The Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because of filename mismatches:

- **Expected by workflow**: `Secura Auth Setup v1.0.0.exe`
- **Actually generated**: `Secura Auth Setup 1.0.0.exe`

The issue is that:
1. Git tags use format: `v1.0.0` (with "v" prefix)
2. electron-builder uses package.json version: `1.0.0` (no "v" prefix)
3. The workflow assumed both would be the same

## The Solution Applied

1. **Added version step before rename** - Get the version early
2. **Added artifact listing** - Debug what files are actually generated
3. **Added rename step** - Rename files to match expected format
4. **Fixed upload paths** - Use the renamed files for upload

## What the Fixed Workflow Does

```yaml
- Download artifacts from all platforms
- Get version from git tag or manual input
- List artifacts (for debugging)
- Rename artifacts to expected format:
  - Windows: Any .exe → "Secura Auth Setup v{VERSION}.exe"
  - macOS: Any .dmg → "Secura Auth-v{VERSION}.dmg"  
  - Linux: Any .AppImage → "Secura Auth-v{VERSION}.AppImage"
- Upload renamed files as release assets
```

## Filename Patterns

### Generated by electron-builder:
- Windows: `Secura Auth Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- macOS: `Secura Auth-1.0.0.dmg`
- Linux: `Secura Auth-1.0.0.AppImage`

### Expected by workflow (after rename):
- Windows: `Secura Auth Setup v1.0.0.exe`
- macOS: `Secura Auth-v1.0.0.dmg`
- Linux: `Secura Auth-v1.0.0.AppImage`

### Final release asset names:
- Windows: `Secura-Auth-Setup-v1.0.0-Windows.exe`
- macOS: `Secura-Auth-v1.0.0-macOS.dmg`
- Linux: `Secura-Auth-v1.0.0-Linux.AppImage`

## Testing the Fix

To test this fix:
1. Update version in package.json to 1.0.1
2. Commit and push
3. Create tag: `git tag v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1`
4. GitHub Actions should now successfully build and release

The workflow is now more robust and handles the version format differences properly.
